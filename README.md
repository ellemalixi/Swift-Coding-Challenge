# Swift-Coding-Challenge
A master-detail application where I display a list of items obtained from iTunes Search API.

I chose the MVC design pattern because it is the one I am most familiar with and the one I used the most during my College days. This design pattern helps in having clear separation between the application logic, views, and controllers.
